This web application will make a secure password for you.

## Installation

To use this program, click the link in the 'About' section on Github, or get the code yourself and open up the index.html file.

## Usage
The variables possibleCharacters and guaranteedCharacters are within the generatePassword() function and reset each time the user hits the generate button. 'guaranteedCharacters' is what is delivered to the user. It's what generated by the getRandom() function, starting at line 123. To ensure at least one character from each chategory  makes the final password, lines 54 - 61 call the getRandom() function one time each and uses .concat() to add the randomly generated character to the guaranteedCharacter string. Lines 117 - 121 then solves the issues of 3 extra characters being added to the final results.
